This snake file is going to go in my personal portfolio. During my senior year I was advised to the
issues involved in publicly displaying school projects, especially in reference to my VM and Compiler.
I decided I would just start work on my own projects. People will still be able to copy code, but if
it isn't specific projects assigned by professors, I feel like it will be more obscure and just not 
searched out by people wanting to copy paste code.

GOALS
I want to try to incorporate microservices into my code.
I want to focus on proper testing.


I'm reading 
	Enterprise Java Microservices by Ken Finnigan now (9/19/22).
		Finished Chapter One. (9/19/22)
	Testing Java Microservices: Using Arquillian, Hoverfly, AssertJ, JUnit, Selenium, and Mockito (9/19/22).


I was thinking I would do a snake game.
	Initially it will just be a standard game.
		I'll start with the design of the game.
		I'll then do testing design 
		I'll then start coding
		I'll use a GUI
	I'll add the ability to adjust the size of the game
	I'll add the ability to skip to certain levels
	I'll add an AI component that will play the game itself as a display of the game
		I'll test different heuristics to see what is more important in decision making (This will take part after completion of the game.)
		I'll also have to create a different option to display in case of failure(display high scores, display a picture)
	I'll keep highscore records/player stats
	
	what makes a winner?
		getting the biggest snake the fastest/efficiency
		living longest/preservation
		keeping the biggest snake alive longest.
		
	

Design
	Snake
		Board <-- boundaries/size/"around the world"
		snake controls <-- turn/grow/speed
		food logic <-- placement
		Game <-- death/when the snake grows
